## OOPS Concepts:
    Inheritance:
        I have a Child class of Cannon in the Buildings Class.
    Polymorphism:
        Line 16 of play.py have a function build(objecttype), which is used to build all the buildings in the loop after every changes.
    Encapsulation:
        Other than Wall, I have used classes for all buildings(huts/town hall/hut) with objects in them like hut1,hut2,hut3 and King/Spell is also made in a class.
    Abstraction:
        The King have methods like move() , attack().
